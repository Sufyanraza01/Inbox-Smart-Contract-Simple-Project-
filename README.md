# Inbox-Smart-Contract-Simple-Project-
This is my first complete smart contract. I create this just for learning purpose only. Any body can use this repository to learn how to code a smart contract starting from scratch.

Before using this install some commands using npm

1: npm install (to install node modules)
2: npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
3: npm install dotenv 
4: must have metamask installed and must have some fake ethers in rinkeby account
5: must have ganache installed
